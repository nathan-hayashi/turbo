# Polish Code

Stage, simplify, review, test, and re-run until stable.

## Step 1: Stage

Run the `/stage` skill.

## Step 2: Simplify

Run the `/simplify-code` skill. The diff command is `git diff --cached`.

Reviews and fixes code style and structure: reuse opportunities, quality patterns, efficiency, and clarity. Uses multiple Claude agents scanning the diff in parallel. Does not catch correctness or logic bugs.

Stage any changes made by the simplifier.

## Step 3: Review and Fix

Run the `/review-code` skill. The diff command is `git diff --cached`.

Catches correctness and logic bugs: missing guards, security issues, incorrect conditions, unhandled edge cases. Uses a different reviewer than Step 2 and catches different problems. Always run this step even if Step 2 found nothing.

Apply each actionable finding from the evaluated results directly, skipping false positives.

Stage any changes made by the fixes.

## Step 4: Test

Run the project's test suite to confirm nothing broke. If tests fail, run the `/investigate` skill to diagnose the root cause, apply the suggested fix, and re-run tests. If investigation cannot identify a root cause, stop and report with investigation findings.

Stage any changes made by test fixes.

## Step 5: Lint

Run the project's formatter first, then the linter. Fix any lint errors or warnings that the formatter did not resolve. If the project has a combined format+lint script, use that.

Stage any changes made by the formatter, linter, or manual fixes.

## Step 6: Re-run if Changed

If Steps 2–5 produced any changes during this run, run the `/polish-code` skill again, skipping Step 1. Cap at 3 consecutive runs to prevent runaway loops.
