# Polish Code

Stage, clean up, simplify, review, smoke test, and re-run until stable.

## Task Tracking

At the start, use `TaskCreate` to create a task for each step:

1. Stage
2. Deterministic cleanup
3. Simplify code
4. Review code
5. Evaluate findings
6. Apply findings
7. Smoke test

## Step 1: Stage

Run the `/stage` skill.

## Step 2: Deterministic Cleanup

Run the project's formatter first, then the linter. Fix any lint errors or warnings that the formatter did not resolve. If the project has a combined format+lint script, use that.

Run the project's test suite to confirm nothing is broken. If tests fail, run the `/investigate` skill to diagnose the root cause, apply the suggested fix, and re-run tests. If investigation cannot identify a root cause, stop and report with investigation findings.

Stage all changes made in this step before continuing.

## Step 3: Simplify Code

Run the `/simplify-code` skill. The diff command is `git diff --cached`.

Stage all changes made in this step before continuing.

## Step 4: Review Code

Run the `/review-code` skill. The diff command is `git diff --cached`.

Always run this step even if Step 3 made no changes.

## Step 5: Evaluate Findings

Run the `/evaluate-findings` skill on the results from Steps 3 and 4.

If zero actionable findings survive evaluation, skip to Step 7.

## Step 6: Apply Findings

Run the `/apply-findings` skill on the evaluated results.

Stage all changes made in this step before continuing.

## Step 7: Smoke Test

Run the `/smoke-test` skill.

Use the Agent tool (`model: "opus"`, do not set `run_in_background`) to execute the smoke test steps in a subagent. Pass the diff command (`git diff --cached`) to the subagent.

If any test fails, fix the issues and stage the fixes.

## Step 8: Re-run if Changed

Check whether any file was edited during Steps 3-7. Any edit counts, regardless of how small or mechanical it seems. A one-line doc comment fix, a renamed variable, a reformatted import, a smoke test fix — all count.

If any file was edited, run `/polish-code` again using the Skill tool. This invocation must not be skipped. Scope to only the files modified in the previous iteration. Use `git diff --cached -- <file1> <file2> ...` as the diff command for `/simplify-code` and `/review-code`. Smoke test scope remains unchanged (full feature scope, not file-narrowed). Cap at 3 total iterations (the initial run plus up to 2 additional runs) to prevent runaway loops.

## Rules

- Every step must run. No change is "self-evidently correct" or "mechanical" enough to skip review. Simplify findings do not substitute for review. Passing tests do not substitute for lint. Each step catches different issues.
