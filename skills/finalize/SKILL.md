# Finalize Implementation

Post-implementation QA workflow: tests, code polishing, commit, and self-improvement.

## Task Tracking

At the start, use `TaskCreate` to create a task for each phase:

1. Polish code
2. Update changelog
3. Self-improve
4. Commit and PR

## Phase 1: Polish Code

Run the `/polish-code` skill for the current changes.

## Phase 2: Update Changelog

Run the `/update-changelog` skill.

## Phase 3: Self-Improve

Run the `/self-improve` skill for the current session.

## Phase 4: Commit and PR

### Step 1: Determine Intent

Detect the repository's default branch via `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'`. Check the current branch name and whether a PR already exists for it using `gh pr view`.

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user how to proceed. Present the options based on the current state:

- **On a feature branch with an existing PR** — commit and push; or commit, push, and update the PR; or commit only
- **On a feature branch without a PR** — commit and push; or commit, push, and create a PR; or commit only
- **On the default branch** — commit and push; or create a feature branch, commit, push, and create a PR; or commit only
- **Abort** — leave changes staged, do not commit

### Step 2: Branch (if Needed)

If the user wants a PR and the current branch is the default branch:

1. Suggest a branch name based on the changes and use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm or adjust
2. Create and switch to the new branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`

### Step 3: Check for Unstaged Changes

Run `git status` to check for unstaged changes. If any exist, stage them. This catches files modified by auto-formatters that were not re-staged.

### Step 4: Commit

Run the `/commit-staged` skill.

If the commit fails due to a pre-commit hook (formatter, linter), fix the issues — or run the project's format/lint script to auto-fix — then **re-stage all modified files** before retrying. Pre-commit hooks may modify files in the working tree without updating the staging area.

### Step 5: Push and Create or Update PR (if Requested)

- **Push only** — push (do not create or update a PR)
- **Create PR** — push with `-u` and run the `/create-pr` skill
- **Update PR** — push and run the `/update-pr` skill
- **Skip** — end the workflow (do not push)

### Step 6: Resolve PR Comments

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask if the user wants to wait for automated reviewers to finish and resolve comments.

- **Skip** — end the workflow
- **Resolve comments** — run the `/resolve-pr-comments` skill

## Rules

- Diff size, number of files changed, passing tests, or perceived user urgency are not reasons to skip a phase. Each phase does work beyond what those signals cover.
- Never stage or commit files containing secrets (`.env`, credentials, API keys). Warn if detected.
- Do not present diffs to the user — the user reviews diffs in an external git client. Use `git diff` internally as needed.
- If a non-test step fails (polish, review), stop and report the failure. Do not skip ahead.
