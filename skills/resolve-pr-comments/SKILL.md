# Resolve PR Review Comments

Fetch unresolved review comments from a GitHub PR, critically evaluate each one, fix or skip based on confidence, and reply to each thread.

## Task Tracking

At the start, use `TaskCreate` to create a task for each step:

1. Fetch comments
2. Triage review body comments
3. Evaluate
4. Apply findings
5. Finalize
6. Draft replies
7. Post replies
8. Summary

## Step 1: Fetch Comments

Fetch review threads, top-level review body comments, and PR commits from the PR:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $pr) {
      title url
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id isResolved isOutdated
          comments(first: 50) {
            nodes { author { login } body path line }
          }
        }
      }
      reviews(first: 50) {
        nodes {
          author { login }
          body state submittedAt
        }
      }
      commits(last: 50) {
        nodes {
          commit {
            oid abbreviatedOid message committedDate
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner='{owner}' -f repo='{repo}' -F pr={pr_number}
```

Auto-detect owner, repo, and PR number from current branch if not provided. Filter review threads to unresolved only. Filter reviews to those with a non-empty body, excluding `PENDING` state (unsubmitted drafts).

## Step 2: Triage Review Body Comments

For each review body comment (non-empty body, non-PENDING), check whether a commit in the PR already addresses it. Compare the review's `submittedAt` timestamp against each commit's `committedDate`. Only commits **after** the review was submitted can address it.

To determine if a commit addresses a review body comment, start with commit messages. Only read the full diff (`git show <oid>`) when the message alone is ambiguous. A commit addresses a comment when its changes clearly resolve the specific issue described — not merely when it touches the same area.

Classify each review body comment as:
- **Addressed**: A subsequent commit clearly resolves the concern. Record the commit SHA.
- **Unaddressed**: No subsequent commit resolves the concern. Requires manual attention.

## Step 3: Evaluate

Run the `/evaluate-findings` skill on the unresolved inline threads to assess each comment.

## Step 4: Apply Findings

Run the `/apply-findings` skill on the evaluated results.

## Step 5: Finalize

If `/apply-findings` reported any changes were made, run the `/finalize` skill to polish, test, review, and commit the changes. The commit SHA from finalize is needed for reply messages.

If no changes were made, skip to Step 6.

## Step 6: Draft Replies

Run `/github-voice` to load writing style rules before composing replies. Keep replies to one or two sentences. Avoid bullet-point reasoning or bolded labels.

**Review body comments** (top-level review comments with non-empty body) cannot be replied to via thread replies — they are not threads. Do not attempt to reply to them. Instead, report them in the summary (Step 8) with their triage status from Step 2.

For each processed **inline thread**, draft a reply.

**Reply format for fixes:**
```
Fixed in <commit-sha>.
```

Only add a brief description after the SHA if the fix meaningfully diverges from what the reviewer suggested. Otherwise, the commit SHA alone is enough.

**Reply format for skips:** Just state the reasoning for not changing it.

Output all drafted replies as text, grouped by file, showing the reviewer's comment and the drafted reply for each thread. Then use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm before posting.

## Step 7: Post Replies

After confirmation, check whether each thread was resolved between fetching and posting (e.g., CodeRabbit auto-resolves its own threads after a push). Skip resolved threads. Post each confirmed reply using:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($threadId: ID!, $body: String!) {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {pullRequestReviewThreadId: $threadId, body: $body}) {
    comment { id }
  }
}' -f threadId="THREAD_ID" -f body="REPLY_BODY"
```

## Step 8: Summary

After processing all threads, present a summary table:

- Total unresolved inline threads found
- Number fixed (high + medium confidence)
- Number skipped (low confidence)
- Review body comments already addressed by commits (list author, state, one-line summary, and the addressing commit SHA)
- Review body comments requiring manual attention (list author, state, and a one-line summary of each)
- List of files modified

## Rules

- Never resolve or dismiss a review thread — only reply. Let the reviewer resolve.
- Process comments in file order to minimize context switching.
- Stale references and default-to-skip policy are handled by the `/evaluate-findings` skill.
- When a thread has multiple comments (discussion), read the full thread before deciding.
- The first comment in each thread is the original review comment; subsequent comments are replies.
